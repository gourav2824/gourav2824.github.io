## Hi there :wave:

* This repository contains source code for my website.
* Here is the link for the website : https://gourav2824.github.io
* I have made this website to share some knowledgeable content with others.

## Setup
* To install the jekyll and bundler gems: `gem install jekyll bundler`
* To create a new Gemfile to list the projectâ€™s dependencies: `bundle init`
* To install jekyll for the project: `bundle` or `bundle install`

## Build
* To build the project: `bundle exec jekyll build`
* The above command builds the site and outputs a static site to a directory called `_site`

## Run
* To run the project (site) on a local web server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* The above command does `bundle exec jekyll build` and runs the site on the local web server
* Local web server address: http://localhost:4000

## Run with Live Reload
* To force the browser to refresh with every change in the site: `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
